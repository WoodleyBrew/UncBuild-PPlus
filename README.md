# For those who want to play the old Dolphin for the new P+ updates. Click here to download: <a href="https://github.com/WoodleyBrew/UNCBUILD-PPLUS/releases">UncBuild!</a>

# FAQ
### <i>What is this?</i>
### UncBuild is just Ishiiruka FPM 3.1.2 but with the latest P+ update included as the sd.raw file. It's simply the old version Dolphin but with the latest P+ patch pre-installed! I also tweaked a few icons etc. but otherwise no actual coding went into this, this is just to make it an easy download for the Unc's out there.

### <i>Can I netplay vs someone on Mainline?</i>
### No, in order to netplay you and your friend must both be playing on UncBuild.

### <i>I wanna play on custom builds like ILPM or ZuBuild, am I able to?</i>
### Yes! Included in the downloads is some pre-built downloads for various reigonal builds, they're just as simple as taking the downloaded folder and dragging it into your UncBuild folder. You can have as many pre-builts as you want, no compatitblity issues etc.! (For technical detail it's just the various sd.raw files saved in pre-made folders for ease of use, this is just saving the trouble and time, and Unc-proofing things ofc)
