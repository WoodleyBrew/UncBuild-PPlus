# For those who want to play the old Dolphin for the new P+ updates. Click here to download: <a href="https://github.com/WoodleyBrew/UNCBUILD-PPLUS/releases">UncBuild!</a>

# FAQ
### <i>What is this?</i>
### UncBuild is just Ishiiruka FPM 3.1.2 but with the latest P+ update included as the sd.raw file. It's simply the old version Dolphin but with the latest P+ patch pre-installed! I also tweaked a few icons etc. but otherwise no actual coding went into this, this is just to make it an easy download for the Unc's out there.

### <i>Can I netplay vs someone on Mainline?</i>
### No, in order to netplay you and your friend must both be playing on UncBuild.

### <i>I wanna play on custom builds like ILPM or ZuBuild, am I able to?</i>
### Yes! Included in the downloads is some pre-built downloads for various reigonal builds, they're just as simple as taking the downloaded folder, dragging it into your UncBuild folder, and selecting the SD file in Dolphin. You can have as many pre-builts as you want, no compatitblity issues etc.! 
(For technical detail it's just the various sd.raw files saved in pre-made folders for ease of use, this is just saving the trouble and time, and Unc-proofing things ofc)
